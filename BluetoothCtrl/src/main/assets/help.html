<h1>Arduino Bluetooth Control</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This application allows a phone, tablet or computer based wireless control of any appliance connected to
an Arduino controlled outlet. The wireless communication to the Arduino controller is via Bluetooth
technology and allows a range of up to 30 feet. This projects uses both electronics and electrical
circuits, which are kept separate via the use of 5 Volt to 110 Volt relay. For automation a
photoresistor is used that allows use of ambiance light to control the outlet.

<h1>Communication Protocol</h1>
The switch will be controlled using an Android application. This requires an agreement of messages
sent between the Android application and the Arduino platform. I have used a single byte (1 byte is
equal to 8 bits) for this messaging. The messaging protocol is defined as follows:

For example, if we want to control pin 13 that is connected to our Relay on the Arduino board,
we will use binary number 1101 in the lower 4 bits of the message structure. If we want to turn
it on we will use 0001 1101 and to turn off pin 13 we will use 0000 1101.
